# Outstanding Issues with Resumatyk
- [ ] ```Style Leakage```: 
	1. styles are apparently leaking over from the pdf or latex document of the resume. 
	2. The starting resume and the variant resume seem to have similar visual appearance, 
	   even though we are only extracting text via pdf OCR
- [ ] ```Cost Reduction/Cheaper Models```: 
- [ ] ```Not Polished/Top-Tier```: 
	1. Variant generations of resumes look and feel tacky and not well put together
	2. they need to look top-tier, best of the best in the world
	3. they need to be extremely well polished with no flaws. flawless
- [ ] ```Not Creative Enough```: 
	1. the variant resume look basic and trash. no ggod font usage, etc
- [ ] ```Small Visual Formatting Errors```:
	1. stuff appearing on the wrong line, etc 
	- [ ] I have a potential solution but i dont necessarily want to do this if i can avoid: 
	      basically my idea is to take a screenshot and feed that to claude along with a prompt to have it fix the visual errors.
