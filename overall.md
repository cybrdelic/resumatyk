### Objective
1. **JARVIS for Software Development**: Create a system capable of understanding an entire codebase and serving as a development copilot
2. **Autonomous Software Generation**: Generate/contribute to tools, or other software
3. **Stack tools that its built to give itself a bebtter advantage
### Tools
1. **Terminal Usage**: installing packages, setting up environments, etc.
2. **Code Error Fix Loop**: autonomously runs code and checks for errors, then rewrites code ot fix it
3. **Code Insertion**: autonomously modify multiple files with a single prompt
4. **Web Search**: up-to-date documentation
